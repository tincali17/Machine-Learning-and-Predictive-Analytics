Milestone 1: Feature Engineering & Predictive Modeling via Python

Submitted: February 10, 2025

This project focused on preparing a unified and analysis-ready dataset for FinMark Corporation, a simulated SME case. We combined Transactions, Products, and Customers datasets using Pandas, then conducted robust feature engineering and cleaning procedures. Tasks included:
- Handling mixed date formats and missing values
- Merging datasets by keys (Product_ID, Company_ID)
- Removing currency symbols and standardizing column types
- Resolving data inconsistencies (e.g., price mismatches)
- Structuring the dataset for supervised learning

The goal was to enable predictive modeling by cleaning and enriching the dataset, ready for churn prediction, trend analysis, or classification tasks.

Key Tools:
Pandas, NumPy, dateutil, matplotlib

Milestone 2: Time Series Forecasting with Data Visualization

Submitted: March 10, 2025


In this milestone, we performed Time Series Analysis to forecast the Total_Cost over a 6-month horizon. Using historical data, we visualized patterns and trained forecasting models:
- Visual inspection of trends, seasonality, and anomalies
- Stationarity checks and differencing for transformation
- ARIMA and SARIMA model fitting and comparison
- Forecasting accuracy measured via residual plots and statistical metrics

The project emphasized model tuning and parameter optimization, supported by time series decomposition and trend-seasonality visualizations.

Key Tools:
statsmodels (ARIMA/SARIMA), matplotlib, pmdarima, Pandas
